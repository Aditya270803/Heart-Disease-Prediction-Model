# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
# 💓 Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation through visual and statistical metrics.

---

## 📌 Objective
To build a predictive system that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at risk of heart disease based on various clinical features.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 📊 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations
- Implementation of multiple ML models
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix
